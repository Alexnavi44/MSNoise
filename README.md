=======

A Python Package for Monitoring Seismic Velocity Changes using Ambient Seismic Noise | http://www.msnoise.org


MSNoise is the first complete software package for computing and monitoring relative velocity variations using ambient seismic noise. 
MSNoise is a fully-integrated solution that automatically scans data archives and determines which jobs need to be done whenever the scheduled task is executed.
