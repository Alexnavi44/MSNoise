Release notes:

Major Release
-------------



This release is not backward compatible. The database scheme and the way to handle the DB have changed dramatically to make the process easier.

The installation process is now much simpler. MySQL is no longer required and the database in/outs are handled by sqlalchemy.

From now on, the documentation of the releases will be available on http://msnoise.org/doc.

The steps names have changed in order to allow the imports of the modules. This was needed for the documentation, too.
