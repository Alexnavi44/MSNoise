Welcome to MSNoise's documentation!
===================================

MSNoise stands for Monitoring Seismic velocity changes using ambient seismic Noise. The monitoring is achieved by computing the cross-correlation of continuous seismic records for each pair of a network and by studying the changes in the crosscorrelation function relative to a reference.

The goal of the "suite" is to provide researchers with an efficient processing tool, while keeping the need for coding to a minimum and avoiding being a black box.
Moreover, as long as the in- and outputs of each step are respected, they can easily be replaced with one's own codes ! (See :ref:`workflow`).
