MSNoise - Documentation
=======================

MSNoise is a Python Package for Monitoring Seismic Velocity Changes using Ambient Seismic Noise.
The monitoring is achieved by computing the cross-correlation of continuous seismic records for each
pair of a network and by studying the changes in the crosscorrelation function relative to a reference.

The goal of the "suite" is to provide researchers with an efficient processing tool, while keeping the
need for coding to a minimum and avoiding being a black box.
Moreover, as long as the in- and outputs of each step are respected, they can easily
be replaced with one's own codes ! (See :ref:`workflow`).
