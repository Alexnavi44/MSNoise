======

Changes:
 - msnoise
  * drop Continuous Integrations for Python 2.7. Only test on 3.7 and 3.8.
 - msnoise.api:
  * preload_instrument_response now reads anything
    obspy.inventory.read_inventory can read
  * preload_instrument_response() returns either a pandas.DataFrame or and
    Inventory object (should eventually be default)
  * get_next_job() now allows setting a max number of returned job (useful
    when processing many stations/pairs for a limited number of days in
    parallel on multiple cores).
  * get_results_all() now returns an empty DataFrame if there are no data
 - msnoise.qc:
  * new group, commands (TODO temporary naming): compute_psd, plot_psd
  * computes PPSD using obspy, saves daily NPZ and PNG files in SDS-like
    structure
  * new parameters in the database (PSD length, overlap, and smoothing
    parameters, see obspy's doc for PPSD.__init__)
 - msnoise.default:
  * now the default config bits are stored in a CSV file, with name, default
    value, definition, type, and enum values
  * the default.default dict is an AttribDict containing all information
  * deprecated bits: "autocorr", TODO: response_format?
 - msnoise.admin:
  * changed the visualisation of the config table, allows filtering names,
    shows modified/new values, definition and enum values
  * when a type or enum is defined, the field in the Edit Form view is set to a
    select box/date picker
 - msnoise.preprocessing:
  * replaced "stream.simulate" by "stream.remove_response"
 - msnoise.doc:
  * added how-to for checking the instrument response
